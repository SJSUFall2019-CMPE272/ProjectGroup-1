### I am giving you my project
Image recognition for determining value of a broken phone 
4 side image capture of a broken phone will be run against a pre trained model to determine damage, location and severity and finally determining the value of the phone. This can be hooked up to a vending machine and put in a mall where people can deposit a broken phone and get a check dispensed. 

1.	Product Recommendation System:

  Idea: To develop a product recommendation system based on the usage trends of the consumer. 
  Goal: To provide better recommendations to the consumers, decreasing their time spent upon searching the products and also to increase           the revenue of the seller by intelligently suggesting the products the consumer may buy.
  Tech Stack: 
        o	Embedded Deep Learning
        o	Python
        o	Pandas and NumPy libraries


2.	Image Recognition System:
  Idea: To develop an image recognition system to predict or verify the identity of facial data.(Could later be extended to expression            recognition)
  Goal: To provide a security system interface that takes the facial data of a person and compares it to the existing database of facial          IDs, giving the output whether the given facial data exists already. This could be put to use for security systems that unlock based        on the face IDs.
  Tech Stack:
        o	Pytorch or Keras 
        o	Python
        o	Deep Learning
        o	Image Processing
3.	Data Visualization:
  Idea: To develop a data visualization application that gives the pictorial and statistical representation of data collected from sources,         which could be extended to process and correlate the data inputs to provide meaningful summaries.
  Goal: To provide an easy format of data interpretation to the end user, reducing the man hours spent on the calculations that need to be         invested in order to achieve these outputs.
  Tech Stack:
